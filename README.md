# Python and Jupyter
After this lecture/tutorial you will be able to 
* be able to write and execute Python code in Jupyter notebooks
* use the concept of variables, common Python data types, functions, for-loops, if-statements and package imports to write simple Python code
* use _numpy_ arrays to perform simple calculations with sequences of values
* visualisation of 1D data with _matplotlib_  

## Get started
For this lecure, you need *jupyter*, *numpy*, *matplotlib*, and *pandas* to be installed on your computer (most likely this is already the case). If not install these packages from the command line with *Python* the package manager *pip*.

Open a Terminal window and navigate to the folder of this repository. Then type:

```jupyter notebook```

## Exercise 1
1. Create a local copy (clone) of the following project: [https://github.com/uu-python/particpants](https://github.com/uu-python/particpants)
2. Create a new file ```YOURNAME.md```
3. Write something about yourself and add your file to the files tracked by git
4. Commit your changes and give a meaningful log message
5. Update your local repository by pulling from the remote
6. Update the remote repository by pushing your local changes

## Exercise 2
1. Create a local copy (clone) of the following project:  [https://github.com/uu-python/particpants](https://github.com/uu-python/particpants)
2. Create a new branch "yourname"
3. Edit a certain section of the file ```cheatsheet.md``` which was given to you by the teachers.
4. Commit your changes and give a meaningful log message
5. Push your local to remote branch with the same name
6. Switch to the master branch and merge the branch “yourname" into master
7. Update local master branch (pull)
8. Update remote master branch (push)
