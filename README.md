# *Python* on *Jupyter*
After this tutorial you will be able to 
* be able to write and execute *Python* code in *Jupyter Notebooks*
* use *Python* variables of the most common data types, functions, for-loops, if-statements and package imports
* use *numpy* arrays to perform basic calculations with sequences of values
* visualise your 1D data with *matplotlib*

## Get started
For this lecure, you need *jupyter*, *numpy*, *matplotlib*, and *pandas* to be installed on your computer (most likely this is already the case). If not install these packages from the command line with the package manager *pip* ([more info](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#installing-packages)).

Open a Terminal window and download a copy of this repository (clone). Navigate into the folder of this repository and type:

```jupyter notebook```

A browser window will open and you will be able to access the three exercises saved in separate notebooks:

## Exercise 1
